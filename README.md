## Portable launcher and updater for owlcms server

This is meant to provide a small compiled binary to launch owlcms, removing the need for an installer
and providing the same user experience on all platforms.
- allows downloading one or more versions of owlcms
- select which one to run
- if Java is not present, a local copy is downloaded correctly for the current platform.

Currently supported: Windows, Raspberry Pi (Linux ARM64), Linux on Intel (AMD64)

In theory this would work on a Mac, author does not own a Mac to perform the required code signing. Volunteers welcome.
